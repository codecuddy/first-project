    <h2 style="color: green; text-align: center">Introduction</h2>
    <p1>Traditionally, resumes were pieces of paper that highlighted a person's abilities, accomplishments,
    and what they knew.  Today, things are different.  We're constantly searching for a way to stand out above the 
    rest, especially in a competative job market.  This page is my attempt to <strong>stand out</strong> and to
    <em>show</em> my abilities rather than having you simply read them on a piece of paper.</br>
    Below are some of my accomplishments, displayed in a web based format.  All of the coding, features,
    and layout were done by me.  I'm sure you're thinking, whoop-di-do, another web page, but this one is different.
    This page is different because I taught myself everything you see here through open-source information, coding websites,
    and peer-to-peer networks.  Thank you for your attention to my project, I hope you enjoy.</br>
